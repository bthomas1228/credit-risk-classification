# credit-risk-classification

Data Science stack exchange (datscience.stackexchange.com) was used to better understand the scores produced by the classification report using a real world example (baketball statistics predictng draft to NBA status). 

The activities were used as example code and guidance to complete the analysis portion of the homework. The report template provide in the starter file was used to fill out the report. 

To access the homework, please visit the linked repo and go into the credit_risk directory. Open the credit_risk_classification python script using Jupyter notebook. Please read the 'final_report' for a description of the analysis, results and summary.
